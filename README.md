# Hotel Reviews Analysis
In this research, I am interested in the relationship between consumers' service expectation and cultural background. In order to analyze it, I found a dataset online that includes hotel reviews (N = 470,000) from reviewers around the world(N of countries = 66). I designed a list of keywords and extracted all the service-relevant reviews, that ended up with a subset of 47,878 hotel reviews.
Each reviewer left a review score (0-10), a negative comment, a positive comment. I also matched the Individualism (IND) score and power distance (PD) score of each country from Hofstede-insights.com to participants based on their nationality information.
